twitter-text-php
================

A php implementation of Twitter's text processing library

# Description
This an unofficial port of the twitter-text-js (https://github.com/twitter/twitter-text-js) library.
For maintainability the structure of the code is as close to the js-library as possible.

# twitter-text-js
A JavaScript utility that provides text processing routines for Tweets.  This library conforms to a common test suite shared by many other implementations, particularly twitter-text.gem (Ruby).  The library provides autolinking and extraction for URLs, usernames, lists, and hashtags.

# Changelog
* 2013-06-06 - first version with support (only!) for TwttrText::extractHashtags() & TwttrText::extractHashtagsWithIndices()
